** Introduction:
   A joint research adventure by jaw & smart
   
*** Goal(ideas):
    - to Explore our passions/interests/...
    - to apply ourselves (to the best of our abilities)
    - to learn/grow/discover/...
    - ...

*** Other:
    - could add todo's here, make this like our research journal...

**** TODO
     - finalise the steps
     - finalise our individual and shared interests 
     - find interesting/fun/unique/creative/... ideas for each of the steps. 
      
** Topic:
*** Individual interests:
**** Jonathan:
     - Fields
       - math
       - comp sci
       - physics
       - other sciences (chem, bio, social sci)
       - humanities (art, film, music,...)
        
     - Areas:
       - robotics
       - (complex) systems
       - foundations 
       - ....

*** Joint interests:
**** The list:
     - quantum stuff
     
**** The "equation":
     
     The equation that we divised about what/how we want to do (things), which we can then apply to various different application
 
     **It goes as follows**:

     Over view of main steps: 
         Step 1: Analyse the (appplied) science of some system
             - more theoretical
             - potential systems:
               - **Extremes**
               - Quantum stuff
                  
         Step 2: Model it 
         Step 3: Apply the model in some (computationally) creative manner to some system
             - more analytical
             - potential systems: 
               - climate stuff
               - public health
       

***** Step 1 in depth
      
***** Step 2 in depth
      - Inspiration
        - cellular automata (so meaning build something similar)

          
***** Step 3 in depth
